## Features

- Automatic speech transcription with WhisperX
- Automatic language detection
- Word-level timestamp alignment
- Speaker diarization (optional)
- Highly parallelized batch processing
- Voice activity detection with configurable parameters
- RunPod serverless compatibility

    "batch_size": 32,
    "debug": true
  }
}
```

### Full Configuration with Diarization

```json
{
  "input": {
    "audio_file": "https://github.com/runpod-workers/sample-inputs/raw/main/audio/gettysburg.wav",
    "language": "en",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "temperature": 0.2,
    "align_output": true,
    "diarization": true,
    "huggingface_access_token": "YOUR_HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN",
    "min_speakers": 2,
    "max_speakers": 5,
    "debug": true
  }
}
```

## Output Format

The service returns a JSON object structured as follows:

### Without Diarization

      ]
    }

  }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- **GPU Memory**: Adjust `batch_size` based on available GPU memory for optimal performance
- **Processing Time**: Enabling diarization and alignment will increase processing time
- **File Size**: Large audio files may require more processing time and resources
- **Language Detection**: For shorter audio clips, language detection may be less accurate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Model was trained with pyannote.audio 0.0.1, yours is X.X.X"**
   - This is a warning only and shouldn't affect functionality in most cases
   - If issues persist, consider downgrading pyannote.audio

2. **Diarization failures**
   - Ensure you're providing a valid HuggingFace access token
   - Try specifying reasonable min/max speaker values
